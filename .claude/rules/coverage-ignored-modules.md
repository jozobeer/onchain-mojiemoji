# Coverage-Ignored Modules: No Implementation Allowed

**Never place production implementation code in modules that are excluded
from code coverage.** Coverage-ignored modules are reserved for wiring,
contracts, and stubs — putting real logic there lets bugs hide behind the
ignore rule.

## How to Identify Ignored Modules

Check the project's coverage config (most common):

- `codecov.yml` → `ignore:` list
- `.codecov.yml` → same
- SPM: look for `ignore` blocks referencing `Sources/<Module>/**`
- JS: `jest.config.js` `coveragePathIgnorePatterns`, `nyc` `exclude`
- Python: `.coveragerc` `omit`
- Rust: `tarpaulin` `exclude-files`, `cargo-llvm-cov` `--ignore-filename-regex`

Before adding code to any module, confirm it is **not** on that list. If
it is, the module is reserved for one of:

- Protocol / interface definitions (contract layer)
- Test stubs / `testValue` for DI frameworks
- Dependency injection wiring (just `liveValue = Foo()` one-liners)
- Type re-exports / module facades

## Why

A module excluded from coverage is effectively invisible to quality
gates. Implementation placed there:

- Ships without test enforcement — bugs land silently
- Bypasses the coverage threshold that applies to every other module
- Misleads reviewers: "coverage is green" no longer means what it says
- Creates a temptation to quietly move uncovered code there to hit CI targets

Coverage ignore is a scalpel for files that are structurally hard to
test (DI graphs, auto-generated code). It is not a shortcut to avoid
writing tests.

## Correct Pattern

When a protocol is defined in an ignored module (e.g. `Domain`) and
needs a live implementation:

1. Put the implementation in its **own covered module** (e.g.
   `Sources/SystemRandomSource/`, `Sources/FooProviderImpl/`)
2. The ignored DI module only holds the one-line `liveValue` wiring,
   importing the covered module
3. Add tests for the implementation module

```text
Sources/Domain/            # ignored — protocol + testValue stub
Sources/RandomSource/      # covered — SystemRandomSource
Sources/DependencyInjection/  # ignored — `liveValue = SystemRandomSource()`
Tests/RandomSourceTests/   # tests for the implementation
```

## Red Flags

- "I'll just drop this helper in Domain/DI, it's only 3 lines" — no
- "Coverage went up after I moved this file to the ignore list" — red flag
- Implementation file in ignored module that does anything beyond
  `static let liveValue = X()` — move it out
